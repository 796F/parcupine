1) the TestServices.java and TestServicePortType.java class are not meant to be changed. so touch the codes in there
2) Create a custom service class that implement the TestSErvicePortType to insert custom application logic
    
 3) the only way to create the TestResponseType object is through the ObjectFactory. 
    Don't use any of the constructor in those generated types
