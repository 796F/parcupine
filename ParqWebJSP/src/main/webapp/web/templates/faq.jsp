			<h3>What is included with the app downloaded from the Android
				Market?</h3>
			<p>The App is a "one-touch" parking system. It allows a user to
				start their parking with the touch of a button. Furthermore, the App
				serves as a reminder of how much time is left, sends reminders when
				the meter is running out, and allows for a user to refill the meter
				wherever they are. Finally, the App also acts as a tool to locate
				the user's car when they are ready to leave.</p>
